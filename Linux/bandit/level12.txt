    tr: missing operand after ‘A-Za-z’
    Two strings must be given when translating.
    Try 'tr --help' for more information.

    The password is 5Te8Y4drgCRfCx8ugdwuEX8KFC6k2EUu

the "from characters" are given as '[a-z]'. The "to characters" are given as '[n-za-m]' . 
The single-quotes keep the shell that interprets the command line from doing anything to the two arguments. 
tr treats square-bracketed arguments as ranges. So '[a-z]' means "all lower case characters from 'a' to 'z', inclusive". 
The second argument is a bit more complicated,'[n-za-m]'` means "lower case characters from 'n' to 'z' inclusive, 
and lower-case characters from 'a' to 'm', inclusive'

tr transliterates all input 'a' characters to 'n', 'b' to 'm', 'c' to 'o', etc, up to 'n' characters output 
as 'z'. 'o' characters in input get output as 'a', 'p' to 'b', 'q' to 'c' and so forth. 'z' characters in input get output as 'l'.
